            <p><button class="h-btn"> is a wonderful free activity on vacation! It’s really great to find a trail and just take a long walk, exploring along the way. If you are fit and enjoy a good hike, then you can do a bit more strenuous hike for a bit of exercise too. However, don’t worry if you aren’t a big hiker! Going for a hike can really just be going on a leisurely stroll on a trail through a scenic place. We’ve found some nice hiking trails in local parks and in open areas near lakes and rivers where we can just pull off and go explore for a couple hours. Hiking is a lovely way to breathe in some fresh air, relax and enjoy your surroundings.</button></p>

            <p><button class="h-btn">Most of us take a ton of photos during our trip. So this is a given really, but how about kicking it up a notch and turning your photo taking into an adventure. There are a number of photo scavenger hunts that you can find online or you can just make up your own for yourself, or even with your travel partners. I enjoy taking photos, but I like it even more when I feel like I’m on a mission hunting for something. It makes me look with a more careful eye, and I will zoom in and take the photos differently and from different angles rather than just a plain boring shot of the landscape.</button></p>

            <p><button class="h-btn">In many travel destinations you can find local parks to hang out and enjoy. There are some truly beautiful and iconic parks to be explored, such as Central Park in New York City, but there are also small parks to enjoy. Many cities around Europe are known to have some wonderful parks to enjoy. And for me, some of my favorite experiences in places such as London and Paris was just sitting in the local parks and soaking up local life.

                But even here in the States, we’ve found some wonderful parks even in small towns to enjoy. And if our dog, Hana, is traveling with us then we are always on the lookout for a good dog park as well. Over the years we’ve found some pretty amazing dog parks here in the USA where we’ve had a lovely day!</button></p>
